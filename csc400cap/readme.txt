Create a Order Class that uses a queue to hold the orders in the order
 they were taken. The queue should contain the customer last name,
  order number, and order total cost.
  ----------------------------------------------------------------
Create a Display Class that will store a copy of the order queue 
in two arrays. Each array will contain the order list but one will
 be sorted by name and the other sorted by order number.
  When a order is taken and stored in the Order Class the 
  program will update the
Display Class arrays automatically sort them in descending
 order using quick sort and outputs the the contents to the 
 console upon each entry of new data.
 ----------------------------------------------------------------
Create a Main Class that will handle operator data input and 
when an order is added or removed, the program will update the
 Order Class and Display Class. The user will be presented 
 a menu to add a order, remove a order and display the order
  list from the queue.
